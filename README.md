# war

Welcome to my version of the Card game War!

## Getting Started
You can get started playing this game a few different ways!
If you just want to play quickly, the latest jar is stored at target/war-1.jar
As long as you have java installed you can run java -jar war-1.jar in a command line and you'll be playing war!

If you want to run all the tests and build the project you will need to have maven installed.
'mvn clean install' will build the project/run the tests/and generate a fresh jar.

Have fun!
